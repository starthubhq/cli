# Git-Based Architecture

StartHub is built on a git-based architecture for distributing execution units (actions), which provides significant advantages over traditional SaaS systems.

## What Makes StartHub Different

### Traditional SaaS Systems (Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, etc.)
- **Flows stored in vendor database** - You don't own your workflows
- **Centralized** - Single point of failure (vendor's servers)
- **Opaque** - Hard to verify what's actually running
- **Vendor lock-in** - Can't easily migrate or export workflows

### StartHub
- **Flows stored in git repositories** - You own your workflows completely
- **Decentralized** - Uses git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- **Transparent** - Source code and execution units in same repository
- **No lock-in** - Easy to migrate, fork, or self-host

## Key Advantages

### 1. Transparent Execution Units

**SaaS System (Zapier)**
```bash
# Flows stored in Zapier's database
# You can't see the source code of integrations
# No guarantee what's actually running
# You get a black box integration, not transparency
```

**StartHub Action**
```bash
git clone starthubhq/http-get-wasm
# You get complete source code AND the execution unit
# Git history shows exactly what changed and when
# You can verify source matches the published execution unit
# You get a ready-to-execute unit, not just code
```

**Benefits:**
- **Auditability** - See exactly what execution unit is running
- **Security** - Verify source matches published execution unit
- **Learning** - Study how execution units are implemented
- **Forking** - Create your own execution unit easily

### 2. Version Control and History

**SaaS System (Microsoft Power Automate)**
```json
// Flows stored in Microsoft's database
// No version control
// Changes not tracked
// Can't see what changed when
// No rollback capability
```

**StartHub Versioning**
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "uses": {
        "name": "starthubhq/http-get-wasm:0.0.16"  // Exact version
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Exact versions** - No surprise updates
- **Git history** - See what changed between versions
- **Rollback** - Easy to revert to previous versions
- **Branching** - Use experimental versions from branches

### 3. Collaborative Development

**SaaS System (Zapier)**
```bash
# Flows stored in Zapier's database
# No collaboration features
# Can't fork or modify integrations
# No code review process
# Vendor controls all updates
```

**StartHub Action Development**
```bash
# Fork the repository
git clone starthubhq/http-get-wasm
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Use immediately in compositions
```

**Benefits:**
- **Immediate use** - Use your fork right away
- **No waiting** - Don't depend on maintainer approval
- **Experimentation** - Try different approaches
- **Community** - Easy to contribute back

### 4. Offline Development

**SaaS System (Microsoft Power Automate)**
```bash
# Requires internet connection
# Can't work offline
# Flows stored in Microsoft's cloud
# No local development capability
```

**StartHub Offline Development**
```bash
git clone starthubhq/http-get-wasm  # Works offline
# All source code available locally
# Can modify and test without internet
# Git handles synchronization when online
```

**Benefits:**
- **Offline work** - Develop without internet
- **Local modifications** - Change actions locally
- **Version control** - Track your changes
- **Sync when ready** - Push changes when online

## Traceability, Rollbacks, and No Lock-in

### Complete Traceability

**Git History Provides Full Traceability**
```bash
# See complete history of any action
git log --oneline starthubhq/http-get-wasm
# Output:
# a1b2c3d Fix security vulnerability
# e4f5g6h Add retry logic
# i7j8k9l Initial implementation

# See exactly what changed
git show a1b2c3d
# Shows complete diff of the security fix

# See who made changes
git log --pretty=format:"%h %an %ad %s" --date=short
# Output:
# a1b2c3d John Doe 2024-01-15 Fix security vulnerability
# e4f5g6h Jane Smith 2024-01-10 Add retry logic
```

**Benefits:**
- **Complete audit trail** - Every change is tracked
- **Accountability** - Know who made what changes
- **Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements
- **Debugging** - Trace issues back to specific changes

### Easy Rollbacks

**SaaS Systems (Zapier, Power Automate)**
```bash
# No easy way to rollback
# Hope the vendor provides rollback feature
# May lose data or configuration
# Vendor lock-in prevents alternatives
# Flows stored in vendor database
```

**StartHub Git-based**
```bash
# Rollback to any previous version
git checkout v0.0.15  # Rollback to previous version
# Or use specific commit
git checkout a1b2c3d  # Rollback to specific fix

# Rollback compositions
git checkout main~3  # Go back 3 commits
# All flows stored in code, not database
```

**Benefits:**
- **Instant rollback** - Any previous version available
- **No data loss** - All changes tracked in git
- **Selective rollback** - Rollback specific components
- **Testing** - Try different versions safely

### No Vendor Lock-in

**SaaS Systems (Zapier, Power Automate)**
```bash
# Flows stored in vendor database
# Can't easily export or migrate
# Vendor controls your workflows
# Switching vendors means rebuilding everything
# No ownership of your workflows
```

**StartHub Git-based**
```bash
# All flows stored in your git repository
git clone your-company/workflows
# Complete control over your flows
# Can switch to any git provider
# Can self-host if needed
# You own your workflows completely
```

**Benefits:**
- **Complete ownership** - Your flows, your data
- **Vendor independence** - Not tied to any specific provider
- **Migration freedom** - Easy to move between providers
- **Self-hosting** - Run your own infrastructure

## Flows Stored in Code, Not Database

### Traditional Approach (SaaS)
```json
// Flows stored in vendor database (Zapier, Power Automate)
{
  "workflow_id": "12345",
  "name": "User Registration",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "validate_email",
      "type": "zapier_trigger",
      "config": {
        "endpoint": "https://api.zapier.com/validate",
        "api_key": "stored_in_zapier_db"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Problems:**
- **Vendor lock-in** - Can't easily migrate
- **No version control** - Changes not tracked
- **No rollback** - Can't revert changes
- **No collaboration** - Hard to review changes
- **No offline** - Requires internet connection
- **No ownership** - Vendor controls your workflows

### StartHub Approach (Git-based)
```json
// Flows stored in git repository
{
  "name": "user-registration",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "validate_email",
      "uses": {
        "name": "starthubhq/email-validator:0.0.5"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Version control** - All changes tracked
- **Collaboration** - Standard git workflow
- **Rollback** - Easy to revert changes
- **Offline** - Work without internet
- **Portability** - Easy to migrate

### Real-World Example

**E-commerce Order Processing Flow**
```json
{
  "name": "order-processing",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "inputs": [
    { "name": "order_data", "type": "Order" },
    { "name": "payment_method", "type": "string" }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    { "name": "order_status", "type": "OrderStatus" }
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "validate_order",
      "uses": {
        "name": "starthubhq/order-validator:1.2.0"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "process_payment",
      "uses": {
        "name": "starthubhq/stripe-payment:0.0.8"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "send_confirmation",
      "uses": {
        "name": "starthubhq/email-sender:0.0.3"
      }
    }
  ],
  "wires": [
    {
      "from": { "source": "inputs", "key": "order_data" },
      "to": { "step": "validate_order", "input": "order" }
    },
    {
      "from": { "step": "validate_order", "output": "validated_order" },
      "to": { "step": "process_payment", "input": "order" }
    },
    {
      "from": { "step": "process_payment", "output": "payment_result" },
      "to": { "step": "send_confirmation", "input": "order_data" }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Git History Shows:**
```bash
git log --oneline
# Output:
# a1b2c3d Add payment retry logic
# e4f5g6h Fix email validation bug
