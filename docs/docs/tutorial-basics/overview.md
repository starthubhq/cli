# Overview

Starthub is a Git-based action/composition engine where developers define modules (actions) with typed inputs and outputs. These actions can be composed into topologies: complete deployments of software, infrastructure, or cloud architectures.

Each topology becomes a package-like artifact that can be run anywhere, deployed to any provider, and reused by anyone.

It’s like:

npm, but instead of functions, you share deployable systems

Terraform, but instead of writing pages of HCL, you give users a simple form of required inputs

Docker Hub, but instead of containers, you share deployable apps

Heroku, but instead of a PaaS, you get a marketplace of one-click deployments

The innovation is not a new technology, but a new abstraction layer over cloud workflow
